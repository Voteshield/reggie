primary_locale_identifier: County
# Whether or not the primary locale values are numeric
numeric_primary_locale: false

precinct_identifier: Precinct

birthday_identifier: BirthDate

# This is a newer addition - We need this for EBNR calculations.
# If the state does not have registration date values,
# we may need to adjust how we do EBNR there.
registration_date_identifier: RegistrationDate

# Only use this if state has a "permanent absentee" type column.
# This is not very common though.
early_voter_identifier: PEVL


###############################
# The date format or date formats used in the file,
# particularly in the regular date columns, e.g. the formats
# seen in the birth_date, registration_date, etc columns.
# (The history stuff may be handled separately, depending on it's formatting).
#
# If all date columns have the same format, make it a single value like this:
date_format: '%Y-%m-%d'
### OR ! ####
# If multiple different date formats are used for different columns (ugh),
# make it a list like this:
date_format:
  - '%Y-%m-%d'
  - '%Y'


###############################
# The column that has voter status.
voter_status: Status

# The possible values of the voter status column:

# "voter_status_active" is a list of all voter statuses that should be considered "active"
# voters. This could include e.g. "active", "active_military", "active_federal_elections_only", etc.
voter_status_active:
  - Active

# "voter_status_inactive" is a list of all voter statuses that should be considered "inactive"
# voters. This could include e.g. "inactive", "challenged", and any other statuses that the
# data scientists say to consider "inactive".
voter_status_inactive:
  - Inactive

# "not_registered_voter_status_set" is a list of all voter statuses that should be considered
# "not on the rolls". This could include e.g. "cancelled", "not registered", "not eligible",
# and any other statuses that the data scientists say to consider not on the rolls.
not_registered_voter_status_set:
  - Canceled
  - Not_eligible
  - Not_registered

# The value of the single voter status meaning "cancelled". This should also be listed as
# part of the "not_registered_voter_status_set" above, but also add it here separately please.
voter_status_cancelled: Canceled

# Add any other voter statuses you observe in the data here, with the naming convention
# "voter_status_{X}", even if you don't know what they mean. This will ensure they get
# added as features that can be seen on the analysis page.
#
# If there is a preregistered / 17 year old status, add it as "voter_status_preregistered".
# Currently, preregistered voters occupy a gray area in our data processing:
# they are kept in the file and differencing is done on them, but they are not included
# in our counts of active / inactive / activations / deactivations or other counts
# that depends on having a specifically Active or Inactive status.
voter_status_preregistered: p17
voter_status_suspense: suspense

# The column with voter status reason codes, if it exists. This is somewhat common but
# only exists in around 1/3 of states we have on the platform, so it may not exist in yours.
reason_code: statusreason


###############################
# The column that has party information.
party_identifier: Party

# The possible values of the party column:

# These are the most important three:
democratic_party: dem
republican_party: rep
no_party_affiliation:  pnd

# Other parties can be added at your discretion, if they seem prevalent enough in the data.
independent: ind
other: oth
libertarian: lbt
green: grn


###############################
# General Note:
# Our system assumes that birth_date, voter status, and party columns exist by default.
# If any of those 3 are missing in your state's file, you will need to create dummy
# columns for them and assign the identifiers appropriately.
# e.g.
birthday_identifier: birthday_identifier
voter_status: voter_status
party_identifier: party_identifier
# And then add those columns (with null values) to the dataframe during preprocessing,
# and to the column lists below.


###############################
# Voting History codes

# If absentee and provisional data exists within the voting history, add the vote type
# codes used for absentee and provisional here. You might have to turn on the history
# features described below and take a look at the strings that are getting generated to
# see if you need the extra single quotations on these.
#
# IMPORTANT: All voting history features are turned off for new states by default.
# If your state has this data, you will need to go manually add it to the state white-lists
# for the relevant voting history feature functions:
#
# get_participation() - You can turn this on for any state that has voting history with DATES.
#
# get_local_engagement() - You can turn this on for any state that has voting history at all.
#
# get_votetype_from_dataframe() - You can turn this on for any state that includes vote types
#   with its voting history. You will need to create a "votetype_history" column in the
#   final dataframe, with a list of vote type codes over all elections for each voter.
#
# get_partisanship_from_dataframe() - You can turn this on for any state that includes
#   party data with its voting history (usually only for the primaries). You will need to
#   create a "party_history" column in the final dataframe, with a list of party codes
#   over all elections for each voter (codes may be null for general elections and only
#   exist for primaries).
#
absentee_ballot_code: "'a'"
provisional_ballot_code: "'pv'"
# This is not actually used in the code, but nice to list the options here just for visibility.
valid_voting_methods: ['e', 'a', 'p', 'pv']

###############################
# This is the short list of columns that we should match on when doing "secondary
# matching" between removal and registration groups at the same date. The standard fields
# we use are First Name, Last Name (NOT Middle Name), and Birth Date or Birth Year. If
# your state does not have Birth Date / Birth Year available, it is probably inadvisable
# to do this matching at all, so please leave this key out of your yaml entirely.
match_fields:

  - HouseNumber
  - StreetPrefix
  - StreetName
  - StreetType
  - StreetSuffix
  - City

# Whatever columns you get in the voter file (minus voting history information, we are going
# to reformat and add that later). Also, whatever data types they should be in our postgres tables.
# Most fields should be "text". Dates should be "date". * Sometimes * voter ID or county ID should be
# an int, e.g. if we want to automatically ignore leading zeros. But unless you have a good reason,
# default to making these text too, and then double checking that the text is interpreted correctly
# in our system, e.g. county "4" not "4.0".

# History Columns
# You should consolidate voting history data into a few standard columns with lists of
# election data. You can follow the way this is done in most state preprocessors.
# Basically "all_history" should list election identifiers in human-readable format,
# e.g. for a single voter you will see a list like:
# ["general_2020-11-02", "general_2022-11-03", "primary_2022-06-02"]
# "sparse_history" will be the same list of elections but encoded into numbers using
# the meta-data json key that you will also create during preprocessing.
# If the data exists, "votetype_history" and "party_history" will be lists of the
# codes or parties associated with each election, e.g.:
# ["A", "P", "PV", "P"] for vote types, depending on the codes used in the state.
# ["D", "R", "D", "N", "R"] for parties, depending on the codes used in the state.
#
# Only list columns here if you can actually create them from the data you are
# given in this state.
generated_columns:
  all_history: text[]
  sparse_history: int[]
  votetype_history: text[]
  party_history: text[]
# Same columns as above, just listed in the order they appear in the final dataframe.
ordered_generated_columns:
  - all_history
  - sparse_history
  - votetype_history
  - party_history



###############################
# General Note:
#
# This is not an exhaustive list of everything you might need to include in a yaml config,
# for example you may need to store codes describing race, or a lookup to deal with particularly
# complicated locale or other data, or a lookup for column aliases as files change over time.
# You can also always add any custom stuff that you might need to use for preprocessing.



###############################
# Note on Feature Creation for the Analysis pages:
#
# You may have to do some manual work to figure out if features are being created correctly
# from the available data
race and gender and ethnicity automatically work based on columns with the word "race" or "gender" or "ethnic"
# Go check that this is working manually.

# Date features add_days_since_features()


# Reggie - Don't forget to add the primary locale names (id = whatever our system calls it, name = pretty human readable name.)

###############################
# Note on Inspector yaml config:

# Inspector YAML:
# New summary columns for status ... (only for states with a voter status column)
# status_active, status_inactive, status_other

###############################
# Note on Frontend config:
#
# Turn date and other features on the frontend config side - src/config/demographics.js
# demographicGroupsAvailable = basic options
# changeTypesUnavailable = NOT reregistration

# Poke around and make sure all the features you would expect to pop up on the frontend, do in fact pop up. Otherwise investigate why not.
